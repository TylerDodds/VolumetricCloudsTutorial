# VolumetricCloudsTutorial
This repository's focus is a tutorial describing volumetric cloud rendering
techniques, backed by an implementation
using Unity3D's standard rendering pipeline.

## Quick Start
Load the example scene in Assets/VolumetricCloudsTutorial/Scenes
to see the implementation in action.

## Tutorial
Alongside the implementation, several Markdown files are provided to explain
the fundamental concepts and choices made.
Start with the [Tutorial](Assets/VolumetricCloudsTutorial/Tutorial.md),
which describes the project set-up and a broad overview of
this approach to volumetric rendering of clouds.
